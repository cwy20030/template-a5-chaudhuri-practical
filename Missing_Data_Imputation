#Imputation
##Description:
### There are many ways to impute missing values. By category, we can sort them down to 2 methods: 
1) Simple Imputation             <----   Using only one method for data imputation 
   - Pros: Simple and Fast!
   - Cons: Bias the estimated parameter  


2) Multiple Imputation           <----- Creating more than one rules or using more than one imputation methods          
   - Pros: Reduce biases caused by imputation methods (the algorithm will try to provide a set of possible values)
   - Cons: Often time, it can be complicated to deal with the estimated data sets.


Imputation with mean, medians, regression imputation, interpolation and extrapolation:
#We will show you how to do mean, median and assign a specific value to each column:

hie.fillna(hie.mean(),inplace=True)

hie.fillna(hie.median(), inplace=True)

hie.fillna({'Sepeptin_6hr':0, 'Sepeptin_12hr':0}, inplace=True) 


for idx in hie.index:
if pd.isnull(hie.loc[idx,"TARGET_VARIABLE"]): 
x = hie.loc[idx,"Predictor"] 
hie.loc[idx,"TARGET_VARIABLE"] = (Î² * Predictor + c)
